						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">The tourism sector in Rajasthan is crucial to the state's economy and has farreaching effects on the social and cultural fabric of the region. PadharoMhareDesh is a catchy Rajasthan phrase that implies the state warmly welcomes visitors. The
							state government and the commercial sector in Rajasthan are both working to grow the state's tourist
							trade.The Department of Tourism in Rajasthan mainly relates to exploring new places, planning and
							development of new areas, advertisement and motivational activities to enhance tourism industry;
							similarly private sector generates employment by investment in already developed and new potential
							areas. All these activities increase income level of the society and help in economic growth and
							development. But it has been observed that potentials of tourism industry in Rajasthan have not been fully
							utilized as it was expected to be. Before discussing the problems it would be worth to glimpse at the growth
							of tourism in Rajasthan.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">After observing, analysing and interpretation of data with the help of various statistical tools, for the
							purpose of drawing inferences, Despite the best efforts of many governments, it seems that Rajasthan's
							tourist industry is not growing as quickly as it should, the results are not so enthusiastic; some of the major
							problems are as follows: </p>	
						
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Poor Conveyance System</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Transportation issues are a major roadblock to the growth of the tourist industry in Rajasthan. Even though
							the most popular tourist attractions have good transport links,but there are so many spots of touristic
							importance where adequate and proper conveyance facilities are not available. Most of them are
							unidentified due to this reason. Besides, in urban and semi urban areas the traffic system is not proper or
							even in miserable condition. Most of the roads are not well maintained. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Insufficient Accommodation </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">In last few years the domestic as well as foreign tourists are attracting toward Rajasthan, but the
							accommodation facilities are not increasing accordingly. Seasonal pressures of tourists also cause to price
							hike; these situations adversely affect the budget of tourists and they are forced to cut their stay in
							Rajasthan. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Higher Tariff Charges </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">As the accommodation facilities are insufficient in Rajasthan so hoteliers charge a very high tariff from
							the tourists. The agents also misguide tourists and sometimes they become cheaters. The hidden commission of agents also increases the tariff of hotels. All these situations are main causes of repulsion
							and in result, foreign tourists are moved to other countries where they find good accommodation at
							reasonable tariff.</p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Higher Tax Rates</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">The tax rates in Rajasthan are higher as compared to other states. As and when a tourist enters in Rajasthan,
							he has to pay some extra amount as service charges or in some other names. At every stage- whether on
							airport, in restaurant, hiring cab services or at stay in hotel some taxes are there. This adversely affects to
							their budget and negative impact on the growth of tourism. Besides higher taxes, the service providers
							charge service charges for the services they have rendered to tourists. Sometimes these charges are not
							justified and create a conflict between tourist and service provider. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Non-Availability of Tourists Reception centres</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Whenever a tourist comes to visit Rajasthan he wants someone to guide him properly, but in place of
							proper guidance he is often misguided by the strangers because there is not the facility of Tourists
							Reception Centre. Though, the Government of Rajasthan has established TRCs at the important tourist
							destinations, but these TRCs are facing the problems of understaffing. Sometimes the TRCs personal does
							not have proper information about touristic attractions.</p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Price Discrimination </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Keeping in view the higher earnings especially from foreign tourists, the State Government charges high
							tariff from foreign tourists. We can see this price discrimination at many places, for instance while visiting
							heritages, national parks, zoo or even using camera foreign tourists are charged with higher rates. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Improper Safety and Security </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Now a day, the world is facing the problem of terrorists’ attacks. India is also facing the same. Besides,
							many tourists have been injured at road side by vehicles or even wondered animals. Some of them have
							died, these incidences also have happened in Rajasthan and not in favour of tourism. Contrary, these
							incidences are against the prestige of the State. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Non-Availability of Hygienic Food  </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Cuisine is also an element of attraction to a tourist destination. Whenever a tourist comes to visit a
							particular state he wants to taste the local cuisine. In Rajasthan, food services, especially at tourists
							destinations are sometimes not hygienic or below standard. People dealing with tourists at food centres
							should be educated toward in this regard. Non availability of continental food at tourist destination is
							another big problem. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Overcrowding </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Tourism has become a global activity during these years. The boom in tourism industry has increased
							pressure on infrastructure facilities. In Rajasthan, unplanned and insufficient development has created a
							big problem. We see over crowed at most of the tourism destinations.  </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Inadequate Healthcare Facilities </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">For the point of view of medical facilities, Rajasthan can be said backward. Medical facilities are
							centralized up to a few cities- namely Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur etc. Most of the area is unattained by
							medical cares. </p>	
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4 mb-5 text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<h5 class="mb-3">Problems of the Officials of RTDC  </h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Lack of resources and infrastructure, erratic tourist policy, insufficient investment in human resource
							development, disorganised policymaking, and a dearth of qualified staff at the RTDC are all factors, poor
							innovativeness in marketing, Lack of personnel at TRCs and hotel units, impediment from local people,
							insufficient communication with travel agencies, non-cooperation of travel agents and absence of
							performance evaluation etc. are some of the major problems associated with RTDC. </p>
