						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Sikkim is a tiny state with an area of 7096 km2 and a population of 6, 07,000, with an average density of 86 persons per km2 in 2011. Physically, it is an enclosed basin, nearly 60 km wide, between two deeply dissected north-south transverse ridges, each of them about 128 km long (Karan, 1969). The western ridge, Singalila, marks the boundary with Nepal and includes the peak of Kanchenjunga (8578 m or 28,168 feet), and to the east the crest of the Donkhya Range forms the boundary with Tibet (China). To the north, the central basin is cut off from Tibet by the broad convex arc of the Great Himalayan Range, in which the River Teesta rises. To the south, it is blocked by the resistant gneissic Darjeeling Ridge through which the Teesta has carved a deep narrow gorge to the west of Kalimpong.  This extensive bowl-like, mountain girdled basin has been formed by the erosive work of the Teesta and its tributaries. Due to the steady rise of the land from drainage channels, gentle slopes and deep soil are rare (Karan, 1989).

 <br>
 <br>

							The state is situated in the most magnificent range of snow-clad mountains. It is rich in biodiversity and has a watershed comprising of several river/stream network.
							
							<br>
							<br>
							Sikkim is rich in cultural diversity with distinctive ethnic groups such as Lepchas, Bhutias, Nepalese and Limbus. The Lepchas were the original settlers and are located in Dzongu around Kanchenjunga in the north district. Later arrivals include the Bhutias from Tibet who, subsequently, became the Chogyal rulers of the state and the Limbus are from Nepal.
							<br>
							<br>
							The recent immigrants include Nepali ethnic groups and Tibetan refugees. (Rai and Sundrial, 1997).
							
							 Tourism in Sikkim is principally based on the utilization of natural resources. Presence of scenic beauty, congenial climate, varieties of flora and fauna, and a hospitable host population are the basic prerequisites for a place to become a tourist destination. Sikkim is blessed with exquisite natural beauty, salubrious climate, rich biodiversity and a friendly host population. In addition to this the state’s unique cultural traits adds to its attraction (Sattar, 2011).
							
							 <br>
							 <br>
							The state’s sustained tourist appeal depends on the preservation of its natural environment. This calls for a form of tourism which wisely uses and conserves resources in order to maintain their long-term viability. This can be made possible by striking a balance between the need for socio-economic development of local people and the need for conservation of the rich bio-diversity through the practice of alternative forms of tourism like eco-tourism, village-tourism, adventure tourism and agro-tourism (Sattar, 2011).
							
							 
							Traditional mass-market tourism mainly aims for profit maximization. However, it has been realized that such practice is environmentally unsuitable, creating undesirable impacts for Sikkim which may destroy the very resource base in the long run. Therefore, presently all efforts are on environment friendly segments such as ‘ecotourism’ and ‘rural tourism’.

						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">The strategies for expansion of tourism is based on the sustainable development paradigm so that this sector becomes a major source of employment, income and revenue as well as create economic incentives for conserving the resource base on which it thrives. The aim is for a tourism development that has to be sustainable – environmentally, economically and socially. </p>

						<h5 class="mb-3">Catastrophic floods:</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">This year  Sikkim administration evacuated 1,225 tourists from landslide-affected Lachung and nearby Mangan district areas. These regions experienced landslides and heavy rains last week, resulting in six fatalities. Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Vishnu Lama confirmed that the remaining tourists, a few hundred, will be evacuated on Wednesday if weather conditions allow. Six helicopters are on standby at Bagdogra airport in West Bengal. Vehicles provided by the Motor Vehicle Division of the Transport department took the rescued individuals from Mangan to Gangtok, the state capital. The district administration is poised to remain vigilant, ready to assist the remaining tourists .  The tourists expressed their gratitude towards the state government, Mangan administration, various agencies, and local residents for their care and safe evacuation.In October last year, the same district faced a devastating flash flood, resulting in nearly 50 fatalities. The  incident underscores the challenges the region continues to face due to natural calamities.The ongoing rescue operations highlight the administration's preparedness and swift response to such emergencies.

						<h5 class="mb-3">Environmental Effects</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">The environmental resources, based on which development of tourism takes place sometimes are destroyed and degraded due to unregulated tourism activity. Such negative impacts from tourism occur when the level of visitor use exceeds the environment’s capacity to cope with use within the acceptable limits of change. But tourism has often been used as a catalyst to regenerate and improve the quality of environment. This can be obtained through comprehensive sustainable tourism which is holistic in approach, simultaneously taking into account environmental, socio-cultural and economic impacts (Sattar, 2010). Mountains are highly diverse in Sikkim. Climatic zones are condensed over distances of a few kilometers. On a single mountain, one can experience a tropical climate at the base, a Temperate Zone at medium altitudes followed by alpine conditions higher up, and finally an arctic environment with snow and glaciers on the highest peaks.</p>

						<h5 class="mb-3">Socio-cultural Effects
						</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">
							Socio-cultural intrusion by tourists might be good when we learn things like freeing women, ending the class system, etc. But it is often cited as a negative impact. Sometimes sexual exploitation affects the poor women, girls and young men . Local people can become more materialistic and imperialistic. The growth of tourism beyond a stage often sparks conflicts between the hosts and tourists. Although difficult to measure, there is a relationship between tourism density and the growth of local resentment towards tourism. This happens when overcrowding reduces the value of the holiday experience and creates additional strain for resident population. To mitigate this, the tourists may be dispersed through eco-tourism, village tourism and adventure tourism.</p>

					<div data-scroll-reveal="enter bottom move 30px over 0.5s after 0.2s">
						<p>In addition to all these, the attitude of the local people and local government has to be very congenial to attract the tourists to the state. The tourism industry in India is based on certain nationalistic ideals such as Swagat or welcome, Sahyog or cooperation, Soochna or information, Sanrachana or infrastructure, Suvidha or facilitation, Safaii or cleanliness and Surakshaa or security. Last but not the least, the main core recital ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’, has now become the mantra for heartening India’s culture, and hence a way to make foreigners feel at home.</p>
