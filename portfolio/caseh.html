						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Shimla is a classic example of this scenario.
							Shimla, ‘Jewel of the Crown’ (Pubby Vipin 1996) is one of
							the famous tourist destinations of India. It was developed
							and nourished by British rulers for their own needs. Shimla
							is famous for its’ pleasant climate, panoramic beauty and
							colonial heritage. It is not only famous among the Indian
							tourists but also to the foreigners who visit India. In 2011-12
							total 3608020 tourists visited Shimla city (Final Report for
							Himachal Pradesh – Tourism Survey 2012) Shimla is also a
							week end destination for Delhi, Chandigarh, Amritsar,
							Ambala, Jalandhar etc north Indian cities. However, Shimla
							is over exposed and city has been congested enough.
							Environmental quality has also been degraded with
							deforestation, solid waste, air pollution and presence of
							excessive amount of dust particles in road sides. There are
							also some fundamental infrastructural problems in the city;
							scarcity of water, lack of space, transport, waste disposable,
							over population of monkey etc. It is true that consumerist
							city life and excessive tourism practice responsible for
							environmental degradation in Shimla. Once the ‘Queen of
							Hill Stations’ (Pubby Vipin 1996), now has been become
							jungle of concrete. The present study is an extensive field
							work to understand the chronic environ-infrastructural
							problems of Shimla related with mass tourism. This study is
							based on primary as well as secondary data emphasizing on
							perception and opinion of tourists, persons engaged with
							tourism sector, local peoples and experts regarding the fact.</p>

						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Total 109 tourists were surveyed from different parts of the
							city such as the Mall Road, the Ridge, Jakoo Temple, Kali
							Bari, Summer Hill, Lakkar bazaar. Purpose of the tourist
							survey was to understand about the problems of the tourists
							in Shimla. However, in this case study tourists were also
							asked about their basic information such as their place of
							origin, educational qualification, occupations, purpose of
							their visit and activities in Shimla because these information
							help to understand status of the tourist and authenticity of
							their provided data.
							Among the surveyed tourist 67.27% were male and 32.72%
							were female. Numbers of male tourists are high in number
							because target sample was group leader of the tourists and in
							maximum cases they were male persons. During the survey
							both domestic and foreign tourists were found, 76.36% were
							domestic and rests 23.64% were foreigners. Domestic
							tourists were found from several states of India; however
							majority of them came from West Bengal, Delhi,
							Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab.(fig; 2) Foreign tourist
							were found form Russia, Chili, Iceland, U.K, Israel, South
							Africa and Canada, hence contribution of Russia is
							maximum </p>

						<h5 class="mb-3">Tourism Attractions</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Shimla is a wonderful hill station which is bearing
							panoramic beauty and colonial charm. Shimla has a tradition
							of tourism since its evolution. People from almost every part
							of the country visit this city. It is also a weekend destination
							for several north Indian cities. Pre-independence colonial
							structures still are the prime attraction of Shimla, such as the
							Viceregal House (present day IIAS) , Christ Church, Town
							Hall, Auckland House, Gaiety Theatre, Gorton Castle etc.
							(Pubby Vipin 1996) These heritage sites are mainly situated
							in between Jakoo Hill and Prospect Hill and now these have
							been declared as Heritage Site. The Mall road and the Ridge
							are the prime attraction of tourists and famous for evening
							roaming since British period. Other, tourist areas of the city
							are Jakoo Temple, Kali Bari, Sankat Mochan Temple, Tara
							Devi Temple, Annandale, Potter Hill, Glenn etc. There are

							information of their hotels such as location of hotel, year of
							establishment, accommodation facilities and more specially
							problems faced by them to run their business and problems
							of tourism sector in Shimla Hotel surveyed was conducted in
							different pockets of the city (fig: 5) to understand the spatial

						<h5>Environmental - Infrastructural Problems of
							Shimla City and Present Scenario</h5>
						<p class="mb-0 pb-0">From the questioner survey one thing has been clear that
							Water Crisis is the serious problem in Shimla. Other
							infrastructural issues which have been highlighted are over
							population, lack of space, parking problem, road and
							transport problem etc. Some environmental issues also are
							matter of concern such as pollution, solid waste
							management, deforestation, and over population of monkey.
							Causes of these problems should be understood properly to
							overcome them effectively.</p>

				<h4>Water Crisis</h4>
				<p class="mb-0 pb-0">
					Water crisis is the main infrastructural problem in Shimla.
This city is facing severe water crisis mainly during peak
seasons of tourist flow. The average annual precipitation is
157.5 cm, heavier than the surrounding plains. During
winter this region also experiences snowfall due to western
disturbance. In spite of this optimum precipitation, the
people of Shimla are facing water crisis due to steep
orography. Precipitate water wasted as run-off towards
lower areas. The ridge is a unique water divider. Precipitated
water of east side of ridge moves towards Pabber River
which is the part of Ganges river system and ultimately
reaches to Bay of Bengal. Whereas, precipitated water of
west sides of ridge moves towards Satljuj River, tributary of Indus.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>The present water requirement for Shimla City during peak
					tourist season for a total population of 284635 is 39.85
					Million Letter /Day as against the average supply of 33
					ML/D. Thus, there is deficit of water supply near about 7
					ML/D, which increases up to 17 ML/D during summer due
					to shortfall of snow or rain in previous winter (Official
					Portal SMC 2014). Therefore, the average shortfall in water
					supply is 12 ML/D as on today.
					During the survey, this matter was experienced widely
					through conversation with local people, hoteliers and
					tourists. Local people and hoteliers informed that it is the
					worst factor which is hampering tourism as well as daily
					activities of the inhabitants. Even 30.9%surveyed tourist
					also admitted that they are facing the water problem most
					than other aspects. In budget hotels of the city, washing
					cloths and using of extra water is strictly prohibited. From
					this restriction it would be easily understood that there is
					scarcity of water in Shimla. During the peak season hotel are
					facing severe crisis of water. To overcome this problem they
					arrange water tanker. Supply of water through tankers is
					becoming profitable business in Shimla. During survey these
					type of water tanker were noticed in city. River Indus which meets Arabian Sea. Actually, shimla is
receiving optimal precipitation, but maximum are being
wasted due to geomorphic factors.</p>
